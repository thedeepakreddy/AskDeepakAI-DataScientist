## 🏢 Industry-Grade Architecture & Enterprise Readiness

This application is engineered to meet strict industry standards for reliability, security, and scalability:

*   **Offline-First & Zero-Telemetry Data Privacy:** CSV parsing and data transformation occur strictly client-side via secure Web Workers. No proprietary row-level data is ever transmitted to remote AI endpoints, preventing highly sensitive enterprise data leakage (PII/PHI).
*   **Microservice Decoupling:** The heavy lifting of statistical computation, inference generation, and hyperparameter cross-validation is offloaded to a designated Python FastAPI microservice, preserving the Node.js orchestrator strictly for state management and API proxying. 
*   **Production Code Generation:** It behaves as an ETL compiler. The platform doesn't just display insights; it generates 1-to-1 deployable Python scripts detailing explicit cleaning drops, target variables, and ML hyperparameters, immediately verifiable by Data Engineering teams.
*   **Continuous Data Drift Monitoring:** Implements production-grade Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to instantly flag feature distribution shifts (Data Drift) between historical training baselines and real-world incoming inferences.
